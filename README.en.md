The name comes from **development log**. We have registered [devlog.life](https://devlog.life) as the official address and will open the service there once the production server is up.

> The service UI and the design documents are in Korean. Screenshots below show the Korean UI.

## Why devlog

| | Typical blog services | devlog |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drafts | Saved only when you press Save | **Server autosave + browser backup**. Your draft survives a dropped connection or a closed tab, and if you edit on two devices you see a diff and choose |
| Visibility | Public / private | Public, **friends only**, or only me. Posts you may not see return the same 404 as posts that don't exist, so their existence stays hidden |
| Deleted posts | Gone immediately | **30-day trash**. Restore any time within that window |
| Tags | Typed by hand | **AI tag suggestions**. When the Google Gemini quota runs out, requests fall back to our own AI server (Ollama); if both are down, writing still works |
| Draft ideas | Jotted down in another app | **Notes sent to the Telegram bot become drafts**. You can also get new notifications on Telegram |
| Reading | Just the body | Table of contents, reading time, series with previous/next post, code highlighting, attachments, RSS, dark mode |
| Accessibility | An afterthought | Skip-to-content link, page-title announcement after navigation, focus trapping in dialogs, WCAG AA color contrast |

## Quick start

### Use the service (coming soon)

Once the production server is up, the service opens at https://devlog.life. Until then you can run it on your own machine as shown below.

1. Sign up with a GitHub or Google account, or with email, then choose your blog address (`/@your-id`) and nickname.
2. Write in Markdown under **New post**. The preview updates on the right as you type, and your draft is saved automatically.
3. Choose tags and visibility under **Publish**, and the post shows up on the home page, tag pages, search, and your followers' feed.

### Run it locally in five minutes

```bash
# Terminal 1: dependencies and backend
docker compose -f app/compose.yaml up -d                 # PostgreSQL 16 · Redis 7
cd app/backend && DEV_LOGIN_ENABLED=true SITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 ./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Terminal 2: frontend (from the repository root)
cd app/frontend && npm install && npm run dev            # http://localhost:5173
```

With `DEV_LOGIN_ENABLED=true` you can go from sign-up to publishing with a development login, without a GitHub app key. Outgoing mail (verification, password reset) is not actually sent; it is kept at `/api/dev/mails`. See [Run it yourself](#run-it-yourself) for details.

### Write from Telegram

Click **Connect Telegram** in Settings to get a one-time link that is valid for 10 minutes. Start the bot from that link, then send it a note and it becomes a draft.

```text
> Notes on today's Redis session outage. Cause: connection pool exhausted. Changed it to reject with 503
← (the bot replies with a link to edit the new draft)
```

If you have agreed to AI use, the AI adds a title and tidies up the text; otherwise the note is saved as is (up to 20 notes a day, 4,000 characters each).

### Writing

- **Markdown editor**: write on the left and see the server-sanitized result on the right. Supports tables, strikethrough, task lists, autolinks and heading anchors (GFM), plus code highlighting.
- **Autosave and conflict diff**: drafts are saved to the server as you type. If the connection drops, they are backed up in the browser (IndexedDB) and uploaded when you reconnect. If someone edited on another device first, you see a diff of the two versions and choose.
- **Publishing and visibility**: public, friends only, or only me. While you edit a published post, readers keep seeing the previously published version.
- **Images, GIFs and attachments**: paste or drag and drop to upload. Attachments come in 8 types such as pdf, zip and docx, up to 20 MB per file and 20 files per post. The server checks both the extension and the actual file content.
- **Series**: group posts and reorder them. A series box and previous/next links appear above the post.
- **AI tag suggestions**: up to 5 tags suggested from the title and the start of the body. You are asked to agree to sending text to an external service the first time, and you get 20 suggestions a day.
- **Post management and trash**: filter by status and visibility, and restore deleted posts within 30 days.
- **Revision history**: each publish keeps a revision (latest 50). Compare an earlier revision with what you are writing now, or load it back into the editor.
- **Pre-publish check**: the publish dialog scans summary, tags, cover image, image alt text, code blocks and empty links so you catch what is easy to miss. It never blocks publishing.
- **Export your posts**: from Settings, download all your posts as a Markdown zip with front matter (title, dates, tags, series).

### Reading and discovery

- **Home**: Latest and Trending tabs. Trending covers the last 7 days, scores likes, comments and views with decay by post age, refreshes every 10 minutes, and shows at most 3 posts per author.
- **Post page**: table of contents, reading time, series, previous/next post, author bio and social links, share button, link previews (Open Graph).
- **Tags and search**: browse posts by tag, hybrid search over title, tag and body keywords plus meaning (by relevance or newest), and search for people.
- **RSS**: per-blog `/@your-id/rss` and site-wide `/rss`.
- **Search engines**: `/sitemap.xml` lists every public post and `/robots.txt` points crawlers to it, so Google and Naver pick up new posts.

### Reactions and relationships

- **Likes, comments and replies**: likes update instantly, and comments support one level of replies. Liked posts are collected in their own list.
- **View counts**: the same person viewing the same post counts once per 24 hours. Original IP addresses are never stored.
- **Follow and feed**: `/feed` shows only the public posts of people you follow.
- **Friends**: send and accept friend requests, see friends' recent activity, and read friends-only posts.
- **Notifications**: likes on the same post are grouped as "X and N others," and each type can be turned off. Kept for 90 days.

### Accounts and moderation

- **Sign-up and login**: GitHub and Google OAuth2, or email (verification mail, password reset). Rules and reserved words for blog addresses and nicknames.
- **Profile and settings**: photo cropping, nickname and bio, a blog About tab, social links, default visibility, notification settings.
- **Report, hide, suspend**: report posts and comments (6 reasons), an admin screen for handling reports, suspensions from 1 day to permanent.
- **Account deletion and recovery**: log in during the 30-day grace period to recover your account. After that, accounts are purged one person per day, each in a single transaction.

## Architecture

devlog is a **modular monolith**. A single Spring Boot application serves both the React UI (as static files) and the API, and features are split into package-level modules. Modules are loosely connected through domain events (for example, a new like → a notification). The design rationale is in [docs/02-architecture.md](https://github.com/AIGJ-01-002-blog/docs/blob/main/design/02-architecture.md) (Korean).

```

### Modules

| Module | What it does | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **account** | Sign-up and login (GitHub, Google, email), blog address and nickname, profile and settings, About, social links, account deletion and recovery | PostgreSQL, Redis (sessions) |
| **post** | Writing, autosave, publishing and editing, visibility, trash, post management, Markdown preview | PostgreSQL, Redis (autosave, idempotency keys) |
| **media** | Uploading and checking images, GIFs and attachments; cleaning up unused files | MinIO/S3 (local folder if not set) |
| **discovery · page** | Home, blog and post pages, previous/next post, RSS, the page shell with head tags for link previews | PostgreSQL |
| **tag · search · trending** | Tag pages, post and people search, trending ranking (every 10 minutes) | PostgreSQL (uses pg_trgm and pgvector when available), bge-m3 embeddings |
| **comment · like · view** | Comments and replies, likes, view counts (collected in Redis and moved every minute) | PostgreSQL, Redis |
| **follow · friend · notification** | Follow and feed, friends, in-app notifications | PostgreSQL |
| **series** | Grouping and ordering posts into series | PostgreSQL |
| **revision · export** | Post revision history, Markdown export of your posts | PostgreSQL |
| **ai** | AI tag suggestions (Gemini → Ollama), tidying notes into posts | Redis (cached results, quota state) |
| **telegram** | Account linking, sending notifications, notes → drafts | PostgreSQL |
| **moderation** | Reports, hiding, suspensions, admin screens | PostgreSQL |
| **admin** | Admin dashboard, post and member management (assembles each module's stats, no SQL) | - |
| **shared** | Markdown rendering and HTML sanitizing, rate limiting, scheduled-job locks, error format, mail | Redis |

### Request flows

**Login and API calls**: login state is a server-side session (cookie) stored in Redis, so any of several app pods recognizes the same user. Write requests carry a CSRF token (`XSRF-TOKEN` cookie → `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as Browser
    participant A as blog-app
    participant G as GitHub / Google
    participant R as Redis
    participant P as PostgreSQL
    B->>A: GET /oauth2/authorization/github
    A->>G: OAuth2 login
    G-->>A: User info
    A->>P: Look up member · first time goes to sign-up completion
    A->>R: Store session
    A-->>B: Session cookie + XSRF-TOKEN cookie
    B->>A: POST /api/posts (X-XSRF-TOKEN)
    A->>R: Check session · rate limit
    A->>P: Save
    A-->>B: Response (the server decides permissions; others' resources return 404)
```

**Publishing**: the server turns the Markdown body into HTML, then removes any tag or attribute outside the allow list with the OWASP HTML Sanitizer. If the same publish request arrives twice, the idempotency key makes it run only once, and if the edit version differs, the server reports a conflict instead of overwriting.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as Browser
    participant A as blog-app
    participant R as Redis
    participant P as PostgreSQL
    B->>A: POST /api/posts/{id}/publish (Idempotency-Key, baseVersion)
    A->>R: Return the stored result if this key was seen
    A->>A: Markdown → HTML → sanitize
    A->>P: Check edit version, save published version, link tags
    A-->>B: Post URL
    A--)P: Event: notify followers of the new post
```

**View counts**: the browser sends one request after a post has been on screen for at least a second. Deduplication is a single Redis script, so even 50 simultaneous requests count once. Collected views are moved to PostgreSQL every minute by just one pod (scheduled-job lock).

**AI tag suggestions**: identical content is answered from stored results for 30 days, and slightly edited content (trigram similarity of 0.9 or more) for 7 days, without using the daily quota. When the Gemini quota is hit, the same request goes to Ollama; if both fail, the user only sees "Suggestions aren't available right now."

### Security and data protection

- **Body sanitizing**: the server renders Markdown and sanitizes it against an allow list. Comments are shown as plain text only. A per-path Content Security Policy (CSP) is set, and the UI uses no inline scripts.
- **404 that hides existence**: private, friends-only, trashed and hidden posts return the same 404 as missing posts to anyone without permission.
- **Rate limits**: requests that can be repeated, such as writing, autosave, image uploads, likes, search, reports and AI suggestions, have rate limits (429 with `Retry-After`).
- **Minimal personal data**: view counts never store the original IP, and search terms are not logged. Mail failures and malformed tokens are logged by exception type only, so addresses and tokens never reach the logs. `X-Forwarded-For` is trusted only from trusted proxy ranges.
- **Image bucket**: anonymous users may only download image files (GetObject on `images/` and `profiles/`); listing the bucket is blocked, so image URLs of private posts can't be discovered by listing. Anyone who already knows an image URL can still download that file.
- **Network policy**: PostgreSQL and Redis accept connections only from app pods, and MinIO only from the app and the ingress.
- **Secrets**: credentials are never committed. They go in only as Kubernetes Secrets or GitHub Secrets, and `deploy/scripts/check-no-secrets.sh` checks for leaks in CI.

### Deployment

GitHub Actions runs the tests, builds the image and pushes it to GHCR, then deploys to Kubernetes with kustomize overlays. `deploy/scripts/rollout.sh` waits for every new pod to become ready (`/actuator/health/readiness`) and automatically rolls back to the previous version if that doesn't happen in time. Old pods are not taken down until new ones are ready (`maxUnavailable: 0`), so the service stays up during both deploys and rollbacks.

The current production baseline is `overlays/selfhosted`. It runs PostgreSQL 17, Redis 7.4 and MinIO in the same cluster with persistent volumes. On a test cluster (k3s) we verified the path from sign-up → publishing a post with images → reading it as a guest. We put the switch to the school's shared infrastructure (`overlays/nhn`) on hold because it is reachable only from the school network. The production server and the [devlog.life](https://devlog.life) connection are being prepared. Details are in [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md) (Korean).

| --- | --- | --- |
| Java (Temurin) | 21 | Backend (Maven is fetched by `./mvnw`) |
| Node.js / npm | 22 | Frontend |
| PostgreSQL | 16 or later | Service database (`blog` database) |
| Redis | 7 or later | Sessions, rate limits, view counts, cache |
| Docker | — | To start the two above with `app/compose.yaml` |

Flyway creates the tables when the app starts.

### Local ports

| What | Port | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend (Vite) | 5173 | Forwards `/api` requests to the backend (8080) |
| Backend (Spring Boot) | 8080 | In production it also serves the UI's static files |
| PostgreSQL | 5432 | Account `blog` / `blog` (local only) |
| Redis | 6379 | |

### Environment variables

Defaults work for local development. Production values go in only as Kubernetes Secrets; the full list and descriptions are in [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md) and `deploy/k8s/overlays/*/secret.env.example`.

| Variable | Description | If empty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DB_URL` / `DB_USERNAME` / `DB_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL connection | Local `blog` database |
| `REDIS_HOST` / `REDIS_PORT` / `REDIS_PASSWORD` | Redis connection | `localhost:6379` |
| `SITE_BASE_URL` | Site address used in mail links, RSS and link previews | `http://localhost:8080` |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth app | Development values (real GitHub login won't work) |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth client | Google login hidden |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_USERNAME` / `SMTP_PASSWORD` | Sending verification and reset mail | Mail is kept, not sent |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` / `S3_BUCKET` / `S3_ACCESS_KEY` / `S3_SECRET_KEY` | Storage for images and attachments (MinIO, S3) | Stored in a local folder |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | AI tag suggestions | Feature off if both are empty |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot | Feature off |
| `DEV_LOGIN_ENABLED` | Development login | Off (always keep it off in production) |

### Run

```bash
# Dependencies
docker compose -f app/compose.yaml up -d

# Backend (terminal 1)
cd app/backend
DEV_LOGIN_ENABLED=true SITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 ./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Frontend (terminal 2, from the repository root)
cd app/frontend
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

To try it on Kubernetes, run `kubectl apply -k deploy/k8s/overlays/local` on kind, k3s or Docker Desktop to bring up the same setup.

## Releases

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). New features bump the minor version, fixes bump the patch version, and changes that break API or schema compatibility bump the major version. When a new top version in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) lands on `main`, `release.yml` creates a git tag (`vX.Y.Z`) and a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/AIGJ-01-002-blog/devlog/releases). Release notes are written in Korean.

## Contributing

Bug reports, feature ideas and pull requests are all welcome. Issues and pull requests may be written in Korean or English.

- **Bugs and ideas**: open an [issue](https://github.com/AIGJ-01-002-blog/devlog/issues). Steps to reproduce, expected behavior, actual behavior and a screenshot help us fix things quickly.
- **New features**: we follow the [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) flow. Write the spec, plan and tasks under `specs/NNN-name/` first, then implement against that spec. Our principles are in [.specify/memory/constitution.md](.specify/memory/constitution.md).
- **Pull requests**: keep changes small and include tests. The backend must pass `./mvnw verify` (40% line coverage or more), and the UI must pass `npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build`. Add your change at the top of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
- **Secrets**: never commit credentials or passwords. `deploy/scripts/check-no-secrets.sh` blocks them in CI.
- **Security issues**: please contact the repository maintainers first instead of opening a public issue.
